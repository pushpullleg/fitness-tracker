# ✅ Email Improvements - Complete

**Date:** October 13, 2025  
**Changes:** Fixed timestamp display and email labeling

---

## 🎯 Changes Made

### 1. Email Section Title
**Before:** "Today's Activities"  
**After:** "Last 24 Hours"

This is more accurate because the email shows activities from the last 24 hours, not just "today" (which was confusing with timezone conversions).

### 2. Time Display
**Before:** Activities showed times like `12:47 AM, 12:46 AM` (UTC timezone)  
**After:** Activities now show correct CST times like `7:47 PM, 7:46 PM`

**Fix:** Added `timeZone: 'America/Chicago'` to the time formatting

### 3. Time Window Query
**Before:** Since midnight UTC (`00:00 UTC`)  
**After:** Last 24 hours from current time

**Code Change:**
```javascript
// Before
const todayStart = new Date();
todayStart.setHours(0, 0, 0, 0);

// After
const todayStart = new Date();
todayStart.setHours(todayStart.getHours() - 24); // Last 24 hours
```

### 4. Total Label
**Before:** "Total today: 75 mins"  
**After:** "Total in last 24 hours: 75 mins"

## 🕐 How It Works Now

### Time Window
When email is sent at **2:00 PM CST**:
- **Includes:** All activities from yesterday 2:00 PM to today 2:00 PM
- **Excludes:** Activities older than 24 hours
- **Clear:** Easy to understand - literally the last 24 hours

### Timestamp Display
All times are now shown in **CST (America/Chicago)**:
- If you log at 7:47 PM CST, email shows **7:47 PM** ✅
- No more confusing UTC conversions
- Matches your local timezone

---

## ✅ Benefits

### 1. **Accuracy**
- Label matches what's actually shown (last 24 hours)
- Times display in correct timezone (CST)
- No more confusion about "today" vs midnight UTC

### 2. **Consistency**
- 24-hour rolling window
- Same behavior every day
- Predictable and easy to understand

### 3. **User-Friendly**
- See times in your local timezone
- "Last 24 Hours" is clearer than "Today"
- Matches email schedule (2 PM to 2 PM)

## 📊 Example Email Flow

**Scenario:** Email runs at 2:00 PM CST on October 13

### Activities Included:
| Activity | Logged At | Included? |
|----------|-----------|-----------|
| Running | Oct 12, 3:00 PM | ✅ Yes (23 hours ago) |
| Walking | Oct 12, 7:47 PM | ✅ Yes (18 hours ago) |
| Yoga | Oct 13, 10:00 AM | ✅ Yes (4 hours ago) |
| Biking | Oct 11, 1:00 PM | ❌ No (25 hours ago) |

### How It Displays:
```
Last 24 Hours
(3 activities)

Mukesh
Running - 45 mins (3:00 PM)     ← Correct CST time!
Walking - 30 mins (7:47 PM)     ← Not 12:47 AM anymore!
Yoga - 25 mins (10:00 AM)

Total in last 24 hours: 100 mins
```

## 🧪 Testing Done

### Test Email Sent
```bash
curl https://fitness-tracker-flame-kappa.vercel.app/api/test-digest
```

**Result:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "TEST email digest sent successfully (only to you)",
  "recipient": "mravichandr@leomail.tamuc.edu",
  "activitiesToday": 6,
  "timestamp": "2025-10-13T02:16:28.456Z"
}
```

✅ **Check your email to verify:**
- Header says "Last 24 Hours" instead of "Today's Activities"
- Times show in CST (e.g., 7:47 PM) instead of UTC (12:47 AM)
- Member totals say "Total in last 24 hours"

## 💡 Why "Last 24 Hours" is Better

### Old Label: "Today's Activities"
- ❌ Confusing: "Today" meant different things in different timezones
- ❌ Arbitrary: Midnight UTC cutoff didn't match email schedule
- ❌ Inconsistent: Different activities shown depending on UTC time

### New Label: "Last 24 Hours"
- ✅ Clear: Everyone understands "last 24 hours"
- ✅ Accurate: Shows exactly what's queried from database
- ✅ Consistent: Rolling window, same behavior every day
- ✅ Honest: No confusion about timezone conversions

**Test Email:** ✅ Sent successfully  
**Next Automated Email:** Tomorrow (Oct 13) at 2:00 PM CST
