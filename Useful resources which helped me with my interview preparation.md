Every individual has their own unique approach to learning and preparation. The methods and resources mentioned below reflect the strategy that personally worked well for me. There is no fixed approach to follow, these are simply recommendations and insights that can be adapted and customized based on your personal learning style and preferences.

**1.**      **Leetcode:** Most coding assessments/ online assessments are heavily focused on data structures and algorithmic problems, many of which are inspired by Leet Code questions. The images below provide a quick reference guide covering various topics to help strengthen conceptual understanding.

While understanding the underlying concepts is crucial, hands-on practice through coding is equally important: [https://leetcode.com/](https://leetcode.com/).  
For additional clarity, numerous You Tube videos offer in-depth explanations of these concepts.

This is a very useful list of questions. Focuses more on important concepts. So, you could use it 2 days before your interview to quickly go through the important concepts.  
  

**3.**      LinkedIn is a very important resource. It is very useful for applying for jobs as well as networking. Have alerts set for roles which you are interested in so that you get mails daily and try to apply every day.  
  

**4.**      Try to build some projects and showcase them on your GitHub. You can also upload your LeetCode solutions, as this demonstrates consistent practice and ongoing effort to improve your coding skills.  
  

**5.**      Frequently search if there are any new roles in career pages and apply.  
  

**6.**      ChatGPT is very helpful while learning! It can solve all your doubts and give you detailed explanations. It is the best learning tool if used wisely.

**My Interview Process**

**ROUND 1: Online Assessment**

The first round was online, and it consisted of **three sections**.

**Section 1: Coding Challenge**

This round included **two coding questions** with a total time limit of **75 minutes**. I could use any programming language of my choice.

- The first question was of _easy_ difficulty and could be solved using basic logical reasoning.
- The second question was of _medium_ difficulty and focused on dynamic programming concept.

I would strongly recommend practicing problems on LeetCode to get familiar with the type and level of questions asked. For entry-level or new graduate positions, questions generally range between easy and medium levels.

**Section 2: Email and Text Message Simulation**

This round simulated a professional communication environment through emails and text messages. I was asked to read and interpret various scenarios, then select the most appropriate course of action from multiple-choice options. There was no single “correct” answer, the goal was to assess your decision-making style and workplace behavior.

For example, a sample scenario could be:

After a discussion with your manager, you still don’t fully understand the project requirements. What would you do?  
A) Ask additional questions and clarify before starting the task.  
B) Analyze the information further for some time, and if you still feel uncertain, approach your manager for clarification.  
C) Proceed with what you think is correct.

In such cases, option C would generally be less favorable, while A and B reflect proactive and thoughtful approaches. This round is straightforward and provides insight into your work culture fit and problem-solving approach.

**Section 3: Behavioral Assessment**

The final round focused on behavioral and personality-based questions. It involved choosing between two statements, depending on which one best aligned with your personal preferences or work style.  
  

**ROUND 2: Final online interview round**

The final interview stage consisted of three separate interviews, each lasting one hour. The interviews were a mix of technical and behavioral rounds, designed to evaluate both problem-solving and leadership skills.

**Interview 1: Technical round**The first interview focused entirely on coding and problem-solving. It began with a brief introduction. I was asked a coding problem, and I was provided with a shared online editor, where both the interviewer and I could view and edit the code in real-time.

I began by explaining my pseudocode and walking through my thought process before implementing the actual solution. After coding, I demonstrated the approach using an example and discussed its time complexity. I followed this method to clearly convey my problem-solving approach to the interviewer and to identify any potential implementation issues early in the process.

The interviewer also had follow-up questions based on my code such as, what would happen if we modified this particular line of code, how would you handle a specific edge case, etc.

Since time permitted, I was also asked to discuss an alternative approach.

**Tip:** Even if you are not sure of an approach, always attempt to reason through it. Demonstrating curiosity and the ability to adapt to new concepts leaves a strong impression.

**Interview 2: Behavioral Questions**

The second interview was focused on behavioral questions based on Amazon’s Leadership Principles. The interviewer assessed how well my previous experiences reflected these values.  
For Amazon’s leadership principles refer to this: [https://www.amazon.jobs/content/en/our-workplace/leadership-principles](https://www.amazon.jobs/content/en/our-workplace/leadership-principles)

I structured my responses using the STAR method: Situation, Task, Action, and Result.  
To know more about STAR method, refer to this: [https://amazon.jobs/content/en/how-we-hire/interview-loop](https://amazon.jobs/content/en/how-we-hire/interview-loop)

The interviewer asked around 10 behavioral questions, each targeting a different leadership principle. It’s beneficial to prepare multiple examples from varied experiences (previous work, projects, internships, team collaborations, etc.) so that each response highlights a different quality.

  
  

**Interview 3: Technical + Behavioral Questions.**

The final interview combined both technical and behavioral elements. I was asked two behavioral questions and one coding problem. After coding, I was asked to explain the time complexity, discuss edge cases and potential improvements to my implementation.

At the end of each interview, I was given about five minutes to ask questions to the interviewer. This was a valuable opportunity to learn more about the company’s culture, team structure and ongoing projects. Asking thoughtful questions at this stage demonstrates genuine interest and curiosity about the organization.
